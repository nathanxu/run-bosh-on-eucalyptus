Steps overview.

1. Download Ubuntu 12.04 LTS (ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso) from ubuntu offical site.

2. Prepare Intception VM.
   
   a. use the download ubuntu ISO to make a EMI.
   b. start the vm instace with the EMI and login into VM, to run 
      below command 
      
      # mkdir /var/vcap 
      # cd /var/vcap
      # git clone https://github.com/nathanxu/run-bosh-on-eucalyptus.git helper 
      # cd helper
      # chmod +x prepare_inception.sh & ./prepare_inception.sh 
   c. veryfied the micro bosh:
      #bosh micro help

   
3. parepare the micro bosh stemcell.
   
   # cd /var/vcap/bootstrap/bosh
   # export UBUNTU_ISO=/xxx/xxx/ubuntu-12.04.2-server-amd64.iso  #( full path of the ubuntu iso)

   # rake stemcell:micro["aws"]  

   if very thing is ok, stemcell tarball will be generated to tmp directory /tmp/bosh/xxxxx/work/work/micro-bosh-stemcell-aws-1.5.0.pre.3.tgz
   
4. manually register the micro bosh stemcell to eucalyptus.

   # tar vxzf micro-bosh-stemcell-aws-1.5.0.pre.3.tgz
   # tar vzxf image
   normally, a file name "root.img" is extracted, this is a eucalyptus EBS image file. you can create a volume (2G) and attach it to the inception VM. 
   then copy the content f root.img to the attached volume. then create the snapshot of this volume and register it as EBS image. 

5. deploy the micro bosh

   # cp /var/vcap/helper/micro-bosh.yml.template /var/vcap/deployments/eucalyptus/micro-bosh.yml

   edit the file and replace the cloud properties as the value in your environment.
 
   # bosh micro deployment eucalyptus
   # bosh deploy emi-xxxxx (the micro-bosh image)

   if everything is ok, you will have a micro bosh VM deployed on eucalyptus, to verify the micro bosh:

   # bosh login  (setup the user account)
   # bosh target xx.xx.xx.xx (the micro bosh ip)


6. prepare bosh stemcell

   # cd /var/vcap/bosh
   # rake stemcell:basic["aws"]

   if very thing is ok, stemcell tarball will be generated to tmp directory /tmp/bosh/xxxxx/work/work/bosh-stemcell-aws-1.5.0.pre.3.tgz

7. upload the bosh stemcell

   # bosh upload stemcell /tmp/bosh/xxxxx/work/work/bosh-stemcell-aws-1.5.0.pre.3.tgz

8. prepare the bosh release

   # cd /var/vcap/bootstrap/bosh/release
   # rm -rf dev_release
   # rm -f config/dev.yml
   # bosh create release --with-tarball --force

   input "bosh" when propmt for input the name of the release.

   bosh release tarball "bosh-13.1-dev.tgz" will be generated in directory "dev_release"

9. upload the bosh release

   # bosh upload release /var/vcap/bootstrap/bosh/release/dev_release/bosh-13.1-dev.tgz

10. prepare the bosh deployment file.

   # cp /var/vcap/helper/bosh-vip.yml.template /var/vcap/deployments/bosh-vip.yml

   replace the cloud properties as the value in your environment.

   # bosh deployment bosh-vip.yml.template

11. deploy the bosh 

   # bosh deploy.
